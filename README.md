# Complete React-Redux-Toolkit State Management üöÄ

## Redux-Toolkit  
* RTK resolves many of the arguments related to boilerplate and unnecessary code
*  it helps to solve three major problems people had with Redux
  
>  Configuring a Redux store is too complicated‚Äù \
   ‚ÄúI have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful‚Äù \
   ‚ÄúRedux requires too much boilerplate code‚Äù
* RTK‚Äôs API to make our Redux applications smaller yet still powerful
### Install redux-toolkit   
        npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
### you need React bindings

## Installation
        npm install react-redux

## What's Included
### Redux Toolkit includes these APIs üöÄ
1. configureStore() \
   wraps createStore to provide simplified configuration options and good defaults. \
   It can automatically combine your slice reducers, adds whatever Redux middleware you supply,\
   includes redux-thunk by default, and enables use of the Redux DevTools Extension.

* In simple words this is use for creating the store, and it also, hold all the reducers 
* it Also includes Redux middleware Redux thunk by default for the asynchronous task like fetching the data from api , and All


*  ‚≠ê‚≠êüöÄ After creating this store we must have to provide to all application we can easily access in whole application 

### Import Provider  (Provides Our Store to Application);
    import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

    <Provider store={store}>
          <App />
    </Provider>
