## Key Redux Terminologies

### Core Concepts
- **Store**: The single source of truth that holds the entire state tree of your application
- **State**: The current data in your Redux store
- **Action**: A plain JavaScript object that describes what happened
- **Reducer**: A pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns a new state
- **Dispatch**: The method used to send actions to the store
- **Subscribe**: The method used to listen for changes to the store

### Advanced Terms
- **Action Creator**: A function that creates and returns an action object
- **Middleware**: Functions that intercept actions before they reach the reducer
- **Selector**: Functions that extract specific pieces of state from the store
- **Slice**: A collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a single feature
- **Immutability**: The principle that state should not be modified directly
- **Time Travel**: The ability to move back and forth through the state history

### Redux Toolkit Terms
- **createSlice**: A function that automatically generates action creators and action types
- **createAsyncThunk**: A function that handles async operations
- **configureStore**: A function that sets up the Redux store with good defaults
- **createEntityAdapter**: A utility for managing normalized state
- **createSelector**: A function for creating memoized selectors

### State Management Terms
- **Normalized State**: A flattened state structure that avoids data duplication
- **Derived State**: State that is computed from other state values
- **Side Effects**: Operations that affect the outside world (API calls, etc.)
- **Thunk**: A function that wraps an expression to delay its evaluation
- **Saga**: A middleware that uses generator functions to handle side effects

## Redux Most Important Interview Questions

### Basic Redux Concepts

1. **What is Redux, and why is it used in React applications?**
   - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications
   - It helps manage global application state in a predictable way
   - Useful for large applications with complex state management needs
   - Provides a single source of truth for application state

2. **Core principles of Redux (Actions, Reducers, Store)**
   - **Single Source of Truth**: One main store holds all application state
   - **State is Read-Only**: State can only be changed by dispatching actions
   - **Changes are made with Pure Functions**: Reducers are pure functions that specify state changes

3. **What is a Redux Store?**
   - Central state container that holds the application's global state
   - Different from React component state which is local and component-specific
   - Provides methods like getState(), dispatch(), and subscribe()

4. **Data Flow in Redux**
   - Unidirectional data flow
   - Action → Dispatcher → Reducer → Store → UI
   - Makes state changes predictable and traceable

5. **Importance of Immutability in Redux**
   - Ensures predictable state updates
   - Enables features like time-travel debugging
   - Helps with performance optimization through change detection
   - Achieved using methods like spread operator, Object.assign(), or Immer

### Advanced Redux Concepts

6. **Redux Actions and Action Creators**
   - Actions: Plain objects describing what happened
   - Action Creators: Functions that create actions
   - Must have a 'type' property
   - Can contain additional data in the payload

7. **Role of Reducers**
   - Pure functions that specify how state changes
   - Take current state and action as arguments
   - Return new state without modifying the original
   - Handle different action types

8. **Redux Selectors**
   - Functions that extract specific pieces of state
   - Enable data transformation and memoization
   - Help with performance optimization
   - Can compute derived data

9. **Redux Thunk vs Redux Saga**
   - **Redux Thunk**: 
     - Simpler, good for basic async actions
     - Can dispatch multiple actions
     - Works with promises
   - **Redux Saga**: 
     - More powerful, uses generators
     - Better for complex async flows
     - Easier to test

10. **Redux Middleware**
    - Provides extension point between dispatching action and reducer
    - Common examples: redux-thunk, redux-logger, redux-saga
    - Can modify actions, dispatch multiple actions, handle async operations

### Redux Toolkit (RTK)

11. **Main Features of Redux Toolkit**
    - Simplified store setup
    - Includes useful utilities
    - Built-in Immer for immutable updates
    - Automatic action creators with createSlice

12. **Slices in Redux Toolkit**
    - Combines reducers, actions, and action creators
    - Automatically generates action creators
    - Simplifies reducer logic
    - Promotes code organization

13. **RTK vs Traditional Redux**
    - Less boilerplate code
    - Built-in best practices
    - Better TypeScript support
    - Simplified async logic

14. **Benefits of createSlice()**
    - Automatic action creator generation
    - Simplified reducer logic
    - Built-in Immer support
    - Type-safe actions

### Best Practices and Performance

15. **State Normalization**
    - Flatten state structure
    - Avoid nested data
    - Use IDs for references
    - Easier updates and lookups

16. **Time-travel Debugging**
    - Track state changes over time
    - Replay actions
    - Debug state issues
    - Available through Redux DevTools

17. **Memoization in Selectors**
    - Prevent unnecessary recalculations
    - Use createSelector from Reselect
    - Cache selector results
    - Improve performance

18. **Redux in Small vs Large Applications**
    - Consider app size and complexity
    - Evaluate state management needs
    - Consider alternatives for small apps
    - Balance complexity vs benefits
